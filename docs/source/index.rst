Welcome to the UAVMesh's documentation!
===================================

**UAVMesh** is a collection of ROS2 packages that are designed to 
simplify the process of implementing sensors into large aerial 
robotics projects. This documentation will review each core component 
of the UAVMesh software in detail. There is also a simple, :doc:`create_sensor` tutorial that is more compact and only shows you what you 
need to do to get a sensor working with the full system. This project 
was designed to support The University of Kentucky's UAV labs projects. 
In particular, this project is supported by the 
`NSF Grant #1932105 <https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1932105>`_.


It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API. Lumache has its documents hosted on Read the Docs.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
